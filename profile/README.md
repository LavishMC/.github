### Why are we here?
This was started by MisledWater79(Me), I started this to learn more about minecraft and to try and surpas other softwares that are bulky, slow, outdated, lack of features etc.
I doubt this will be super fast or super lightweight, but I plan on trying my best. If you would like to contribute you are very much welcome to! Especially if you are optimizing it!
At the moment, most the code is private until I get something I like up and running (At least get a client to join the world). But it shouldn't be too long!
Like I said this is honestly mostly just a learning project for me that I wanted to try and hopfully enhance my skills.

### How did I/it start?
I started from just learning and messing with the minecraft protocol and raknet with simple nodeJS scripts. From there it went to looking through a bunch of server softwares and learning how it worked.
Then finnally, I tried to do it on c++ and struggled a bit but eventually got help. Now, I know most people don't care for this stuff but I love it. It was a pain to try and learn it all and a goal I have is to try and make that easier for everyone.
I'll try to answer questions the best I can, so don't be afraid to ask! I plan to make in depth docs on how things work in this software, raknet and minecraft protocol *cough cough* [Protocol Docs](https://github.com/bedrock-crustaceans/protocol-wiki). Kinda all the above. I'll try to document my findings along the way.

### How is development going?
Development is going better! Progress and everything can be found in our [Project](https://github.com/orgs/LavishMC/projects/1)
Ended up working on other things and college so development is a little slow. ðŸ˜…

### Credits
Most everything was coded by me *except for the cloned repos ofc*. Along with other softwares such as SerenityJS, BedrockRS, BDSX, AllayMC. They were used for references and such.
