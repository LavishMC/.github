The New Up and Coming MCBE Server Software!

### Why are we here?
This was started by MisledWater79(Me), I started this to learn more about minecraft and to try and surpas other softwares that are bulky, slow, outdated, lack of features etc.
I doubt this will be super fast or super lightweight, but I plan on trying my best. If you would like to contribute you are very much welcome to! Especially if you are optimizing it!
At the moment, most the code is private until I get something I like up and running (At least get a client to join the world). But it shouldn't be too long!
Like I said this is honestly mostly just a learning project for me that I wanted to try and hopfully enhance my skills.

### How did it start?
This started from just learning and messing with the minecraft protocol and raknet with simple nodeJS scripts. From there it went to looking through a bunch of server softwares and learning how it worked.
Then finnally tried to do it on c++ and struggled a bit but eventually got help. Now, I know most people don't care for this stuff but I love it. But it was a pain to try and learn it all and a goal I have is to try and make that easier for everyone.
And that's by all means, I'll try to answer questions the best I can; I plan to make in depth docs on how things work in this software, raknet and minecraft protocol. Kinda all the above. I'll try to document my finding along the way.

### Credits
Most everything was coded by me *except for the cloned repos ofc* but some credit goes to [vp817](https://github.com/vp817) with his help on setting things up along with his software [AllayBE](https://github.com/AllayBE/AllayBE) for being a huge reference for this.
